<h1>10 Developmental Levels</h1>
<p>It turns out that, when we think about <a href="human-development.html">Human Development</a>, and about <a href="cultural-evolution.html">Cultural Evolution</a>, there are some broadly applicable developmental levels that we can consider. </p>
<p>A number of authors and systems of thought espouse one or another series of developmental levels, in fields of study as diverse as psychology, sociology, economics and organizational development. <a href="wilber-ken.html">Ken Wilber</a> was the first author I encountered who proposed an integration of these various developmental progressions into a single unifying scheme. However, much of Ken's take  on these levels was heavily influenced by the <a href="spiral-dynamics-mastering-values-leadership-and-change.html">Spiral Dynamics</a> work done by Clare W. Graves, Don Beck and Chris Cowan. </p>
<p>As with <a href="the-four-quadrants.html">the Four Quadrants</a> model, this sort of developmental model can help us better understand and categorize some of the <a href="multiple-perspectives.html">multiple perspectives</a> that we humans typically use to make sense of ourselves and the world around us. </p>
<p>So what do we mean by a level of development, in this context? </p>
<p>Here's where it gets a little tricky. </p>
<p>Both in terms of individual development, and in terms of sociocultural development, these levels seem to emerge in a certain sequence. </p>
<p>However, later levels do not supersede or invalidate earlier levels. Rather than replacing previous levels, each emergent level expands the complexity and capacity of individuals and societies. </p>
<p>And so Wilber and Beck and Cowan have tried to use colors to identify the levels, rather than numbers, in order to avoid giving the impression that later levels are somehow better than earlier levels. </p>
<p>At some point along the line, though, Ken Wilber and the Integral crew decided it was important to change some of the colors. I've listed both the original Spiral Dynamics colors and the new Integral colors in the table below, but in general I will stick with the original colors from Beck and Cowan. </p>
<p>Also, there has been a later tendency to add new, higher, levels to the upper end of this range. I've not been able to make much sense of these, myself, so I'm omitting them here. </p>
<p>As we go through these levels, we will see that each one has a particular <a href="subjective.html">subjective</a>, or <a href="intersubjective.html">intersubjective</a> viewpoint, as well as typical social structures that can be identified through an <a href="an-objective-view-of-society.html">objective view of society</a>. </p>
<p>There's a certain chicken and the egg sort of dilemma we face when trying to disentangle the objective social aspects of a level from its subjective aspects but, for me, it feels more natural to consider the objective social aspects first, so I'll proceed in that manner. </p>
<p>Also, it's worth noting that, as we proceed through the levels, they tend to alternate between an assertion of individual power (archaic, tribal, modern, integral), followed by a more community-based perspective (magical, traditional, postmodern, holistic). </p>
<p>Here's a table listing all of the levels, with their associated colors. </p>

<td>Egalitarian; relativistic; situational; accepting of fluid affiliations; acknowledges that there are multiple, valid ways of perceiving reality, and tries to accept all people and life forms by placing value on diversity; may be seen as a means of accommodating multiple tribes, gangs and mythic orders within a single, overarching social order; consensus-based decision-making.   </td>

<summary>Ken Wilber: &#8220;Levels of Moral Development&#8230;&#8221;</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let's use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p>
<p>Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric) &#8211; a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>
