<h1>3 Subjective</h1>
<p><em>aka: interior, inner</em></p>
<p>Each of us experiences a complex inner world of sensations, emotions, thoughts and feelings. </p>
<p>And the inner experiences that we have can be highly individual &#8211; you and I may have very different inner reactions to something happening in the world around us. </p>
<p>These inner experiences can vary from the mundane &#8211; hunger, pain, fear &#8211; to the sublime &#8211; wonder, love, reverence. </p>
<p>And the relationships between external stimuli and our inner feelings can sometimes be obvious,  but at other times rather complex and even mysterious. </p>
<p>When considering the <a href="multiple-perspectives.html">multiple perspectives</a> we can take regarding a thing, some of these viewpoints may fairly be considered subjective. </p>
<p>This is not to imply that subjective views are invalid, or unworthy of consideration &#8211; far from it. </p>
<p>But it's often useful to separate out subjective views from <a href="objective.html">objective</a> ones. </p>
