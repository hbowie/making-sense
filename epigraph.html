<h3>Pete Townshend: &#8220;They Call Me The Seeker&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I've looked under chairs,  <br />
 I've looked under tables.  <br />
 I've tried to find the key  <br />
 To fifty million fables.  </p>
<p>I'm looking for me;  <br />
 You're looking for you.  <br />
 We're looking at each other,  <br />
 And we don't know what to do.  </p>
<p>They call me The Seeker:  <br />
 I've been searching low and high&#8230;</p>

<h3>Ray Davies: &#8220;Education - Conclusion&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Teacher, teach me how to read and write.   <br />
 You can teach me ’bout biology.   <br />
 But you can’t tell me what I am living for,   <br />
 ‘Cause that’s still a mystery.   <br />
 Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics,   <br />
 And teach me about the structure of man,   <br />
 But all your endless calculations   <br />
 Can’t tell me why I am.   <br />
 No you can’t tell me why I am.</p>
