<h1>They Call Me The Seeker</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I've looked under chairs,  <br />
 I've looked under tables.  <br />
 I've tried to find the key  <br />
 To fifty million fables.  </p>
<p>I'm looking for me;  <br />
 You're looking for you.  <br />
 We're looking at each other,  <br />
 And we don't know what to do.  </p>
<p>They call me The Seeker:  <br />
 I've been searching low and high&#8230;</p>
