<h1>2 Our Social Nature</h1>
<p>We humans are innately social creatures. </p>
<p>What do I mean by this? </p>
<p>That we tend to get stuff done by forming societies of one form or another. </p>
<p>In other words, we come together with other humans to hunt, to forage, to farm, to cook, to eat, to share stories, and to do almost everything else that we think of as human. </p>
<p>When you think about it, this makes a lot of sense. </p>
<p>After all, as individuals, we humans are not very fearsome creatures. No thick fur or tough skin to protect us, no sharp claws or teeth with which to fight, no great running speed to chase down prey.  </p>
<p>No, it is only by working together with other humans that we become a force to be reckoned with. </p>
<p>In fact, there is next to nothing that we accomplish on our own, as isolated individuals. </p>
<p>Even when there is no one else around, and we are enjoying a quiet moment to ourselves, we are almost always making use of things that were provided by others: knowledge, clothes, buildings, furniture, tools. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state. A social instinct is implanted in all men by nature. </p>

<summary>Brian Hare and Vanessa Woods: &#8220;Cooperative communication&#8230;&#8221;</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>What allowed us to thrive while other humans went extinct was a kind of cognitive superpower: a particular type of friendliness called cooperative communication. We are experts at working together with other people, even strangers. We can communicate with someone we've never met about a shared goal and work together to accomplish it. </p>
