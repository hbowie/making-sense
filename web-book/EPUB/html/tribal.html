<h1>10.3 Tribal</h1>
<p><em>aka: Red, Power Seeking</em></p>
<p>The primary form of social organization at this level is the power pyramid, a hierarchical &#8220;command and control&#8221; structure in which those above have power over those below, and in which the strongest rise towards the apex of the pyramid. </p>
<p>Written language starts to come into play at this level, as multi-level hierarchies begin to issue written commands. </p>
<p>At this level of development, humans: </p>
<ul>
<li>tend to be egocentric; </li>
<li>assert themselves for dominance, conquest and power; </li>
<li>have strong feelings of loyalty to their tribes and their tribal leaders; </li>
<li>believe that might makes right. </li>
</ul>
<p>This level of development is the dominant one in feudal empires, criminal gangs and military organizations. But the power hierarchy is also a dominant structure in most corporations, in the executive branches of governments, as well as in some organized religions. </p>
