<h1>14.9 Multilevel Selection</h1>
<p>The central tenet of multilevel (or group) selection theory conveys that selection not only acts on individuals but can act (simultaneously) on multiple levels of biological organization, including cells and/or groups. </p>
<p>And so, the individual cells within our bodies are not constantly competing with one another: instead, they display magnificent degrees of cooperation, working together smoothly to form a unified organism. </p>
<p>Similarly, the bees within a hive, and the ants within a colony, are not all competing with one another, but instead are cooperating, because they can achieve higher levels of evolutionary success through cooperation (at that level) than through competition. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion, many different species can cooperate with one another as part of a complex ecosystem. </p>
<p>So we see that, as with <a href="change.html">change</a>, <a href="competition.html">competition</a> tends to draw our attention, but that, like <a href="retention.html">retention</a>, <a href="cooperation.html">cooperation</a> is at least as important. </p>
