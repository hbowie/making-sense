<h1>8 The Four Quadrants Model</h1>
<img src="images/the-four-quadrants-model-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram of Ken Wilber's Four Quadrants Model" title="Diagram of Ken Wilber's Four Quadrants Model"><p><em>aka: Four Quadrants</em></p>
<p>It was modern American philosopher <a href="wilber-ken.html">Ken Wilber</a> who had the insight that the four categories of perspectives we've just discussed could be arranged into a neat set of quadrants by first dividing a square vertically, with subjective views on the left, and objective ones on the right; then dividing the square horizontally, with individuals on the top, and social collectives on the bottom. These two lines then resulted in the formation of the following quadrants. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upper Left (abbreviated as &#8220;UL&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the interior of one individual. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;I&#8221; perspective, from my <a href="subjective.html">subjective</a> view as a single individual. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upper Right (abbreviated as &#8220;UR&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives of an individual from an exterior view. This is reality viewed from an &#8220;it&#8221; perspective, from an <a href="objective.html">objective</a> view of one individual. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower Left (abbreviated as &#8220;LL&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the interior of a social collective. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;We&#8221; perspective, from the <a href="intersubjective.html">intersubjective</a> view of a group. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower Right (abbreviated as &#8220;LR&#8221;) &#8211; Perspectives from the exterior of a social collective. This is reality viewed from the &#8220;They&#8221; perspective, based on <a href="an-objective-view-of-society.html">an objective view of society</a>. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This model can be used as a handy reminder to help us understand the various relevant perspectives on a person, event or situation. </p>
<p>Let's look at some examples of how the four quadrants model can be applied. </p>
