AQAL is an abbreviation for "All Quadrants, All Levels,' used by Ken Wilber and the Integral Community as a reminder to view the universe from all [[Four Quadrants]] and from all [[Developmental Levels]]. It's also used as shorthand for "all quadrants, all levels, all lines, all states, all types." See the [Integral Life](https://integrallife.com/five-elements-aqal/) website for more info, especially concerning lines, states and types.
