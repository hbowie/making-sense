Body: 

Teacher, teach me how to read and write.   
You can teach me ’bout biology.   
But you can’t tell me what I am living for,   
‘Cause that’s still a mystery.   
Teacher, teach me about nuclear physics,   
And teach me about the structure of man,   
But all your endless calculations   
Can’t tell me why I am.   
No you can’t tell me why I am.
