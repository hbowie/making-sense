<h1>11 The Pre/Trans Fallacy</h1>
<p>When we examine the two ends of the <a href="developmental-levels.html">Developmental Levels</a> &#8211; starting wth the <a href="archaic.html">Archaic Level</a> and ending with the <a href="holistic.html">Holistic Level</a> &#8211; we can see that both ends are, to some degree, nonrational, with rationality becoming dominant in the middle, in the <a href="modern.html">Modern Level</a>. </p>
<p><a href="wilber-ken.html">Ken Wilber</a> distinguishes between these two ends of the spectrum, with the <a href="archaic.html">beige</a> beginnings being termed <em>pre-rational</em> and the <a href="holistic.html">turquoise</a> at the top being called <em>transrational</em>. The pre-rational state simply has not yet achieved any degree of rationality, while the transrational state has included and integrated the rational levels, but achieves some degree of transendence over them. </p>
<p>Wilber noticed that many people conflated these two very different states, resulting in either a romantic idealization of the pre-rational, or a mistaken condemnation of the transrational as reversion to an earlier state of development. This confusion he termed the &#8220;pre/trans fallacy.&#8221; </p>
