<h1>6 Evolution</h1>
<p>When humans began to consider the question of how we came to be here on Earth, we naturally thought about that mystery in terms that made sense to us, based on our own experiences. And so we tended to assume a few things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Humans, as well as other forms of life we found around us, began our existence at some definite point in time; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The various types of life found on Earth were initially created pretty much as we now know them to be; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was some agent, more powerful than humans, responsible for the creation of humans and other life forms. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this made a lot of sense, especially to people and societies used to viewing things from the <a href="magical.html">Magical</a>, <a href="tribal.html">Tribal</a> and <a href="traditional.html">Traditional</a> perspectives (more on these a bit later). </p>
<p>But then, as science came along in the <a href="modern.html">Modern</a> era, and we discovered <a href="the-scale-of-the-cosmos.html">the scale of the cosmos</a>, the earlier assumptions we had made began to seem less reasonable. </p>
<p>And when, in 1859, Charles Darwin published his revolutionary book, <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, our creation paradigm began to change completely. </p>
<p>It turned out that all forms of life on earth, including us humans, had evolved gradually over thousands of millions of years. </p>
<p>And it turned out that all of the marvelous living beings we see around us, as well as the complex ecosystems in which they play a part, were created, not by some extraordinary intelligence, but by a process of natural selection that has been described as <a href="the-blind-watchmaker.html">The Blind Watchmaker</a>. </p>
<p>The way this process works has tremendous significance, so let's break it down into its component pieces. </p>
<p>Because of the broad applicability of these principles, I will describe them in terms of the evolution of entities, to use the most general term. </p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Resource Scarcity<br />
<p>If every entity has easy access to all the resources it might ever want or need, then natural selection can't favor one thing over another. </p>
<p>Some scarcity of resources must exist in order for natural selection to work. </p>
<p>Access to necessary and desirable resources is the outcome that is being selected for. </p>
</li>
<li>Change<br />
<p>If nothing ever changes, then there can be no evolution. </p>
</li>
<li>Variation<br />
<p>If all entities in an environment are the same, then it is impossible to select one thing over another. </p>
</li>
<li>Retention<br />
<p>Change can bring both opportunities and danger, and so our brains are finely attuned to pay special attention to things that are changing. </p>
<p>We also associate change with progress, and so it is easy for us to think of <a href="change.html">change</a> as the most important piece of the process we are describing. </p>
<p>But this impression is deceptive. Some degree of change is essential, but the amount of change that happens in each new generation is generally dwarfed by the numbers of characteristics that are passed along without modification. </p>
<p>In order for entities to remain viable, things that work must largely be retained. Changing everything at once is generally a recipe for disaster. As in classic scientific experimentation, it's best to keep all of the variables constant except one. </p>
</li>
<li>Growth<br />
<p>A particular entity, or group of entities, must have the ability to grow &#8211; in size, in population, in longevity, in reproductive ability &#8211; in order for natural selection to work. In essence, growth is the result of evolutionary success. </p>
</li>
<li>Decline<br />
<p>Some entities grow as a result of evolutionary success, but then others may decline. </p>
</li>
<li>Competition<br />
<p>Competition for scarce resources &#8211; both between entities and between groups of entities &#8211; results in growth for some, and decline for others. </p>
</li>
<li>Cooperation<br />
<p>While it's obvious that competition is necessary for evolution by natural selection, it is equally true that cooperation plays a role. </p>
<p>To understand why this is so, we need to consider the next topic. </p>
</li>
<li>Multilevel Selection<br />
<p>The central tenet of multilevel (or group) selection theory conveys that selection not only acts on individuals but can act (simultaneously) on multiple levels of biological organization, including cells and/or groups. </p>
<p>And so, the individual cells within our bodies are not constantly competing with one another: instead, they display magnificent degrees of cooperation, working together smoothly to form a unified organism. </p>
<p>Similarly, the bees within a hive, and the ants within a colony, are not all competing with one another, but instead are cooperating, because they can achieve higher levels of evolutionary success through cooperation (at that level) than through competition. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion, many different species can cooperate with one another as part of a complex ecosystem. </p>
<p>So we see that, as with <a href="change.html">change</a>, <a href="competition.html">competition</a> tends to draw our attention, but that, like <a href="retention.html">retention</a>, <a href="cooperation.html">cooperation</a> is at least as important. </p>
