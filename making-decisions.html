<h1>17 Making Decisions</h1>
<p><em>aka: decision making</em></p>
<p>At this point it may be a good point to talk a little bit about decision making. </p>
<p>Because it is worth pointing out that decisions can be made based on any of these sorts of perspectives we've just discussed. </p>
<p>We can make decisions based on our personal, subjective feelings &#8211; I'm hungry, so let's eat! </p>
<p>We can make decisions based on objective observations &#8211; it's only been an hour since breakfast, so let's wait. </p>
<p>We can use a hierarchical structure to make big decisions at the top, and then pass them down the chain of command &#8211; the cafeteria will be open from 11 - 1. </p>
<p>Or we can use a more egalitarian approach, and make decisions based on the consensus of a group &#8211; raise your hand if you could eat something about now. </p>
<p>The important point to note is that none of these various decision-making perspectives are inherently wrong. </p>
<p>If you need to make quick decisions for a large group, for example, then you will probably need a command-and-control structure. </p>
<p>If you are trying to make an impactful decision with far-reaching consequences, then you may need a more inclusive, egalitarian approach to achieve buy-in. </p>
<p>When you are faced with a decision to be made, it's worth remembering to consider the question before you from multiple perspectives, and to try to integrate those perspectives into a more comprehensive view of the issue facing you. </p>
